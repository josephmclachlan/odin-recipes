            <p>
                If you enjoyed the coquito recipe, this is the secret to make you the 
                talk of the next holiday party. By thinning out the main blend with extra 
                rum, and then cutting it again with more rum in the glass, the coquito is 
                changed from a slow sipping dessert drink, to a full on bar worth cocktail.

                The cinammon syrup is the most important part of this recipe, and an added 
                benfit is you can use it with rum and tequila to make many great cocktails. Feliz
                Navidad!
