        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> 
                Most americans think of just one iconic drink when the holiday season 
                arrives; Eggnog. While a great drink, I find it can very quickly be too 
                much of a good thing, and most parties end with half finished cups
                lying all over the place.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Puerto Rican, I have some magic to share with you; Coquito. Gone are 
                eggs that can spoil, and gallons of milk. Replace it with swet, tropical coconut, 
                smooth rum, and all the best spice the West Indies have to offer. 
            </p>

        <h5>Notes</h6>
            <p>
                *<em>Fresh</em> vanilla works best for a deep and rich flavor. Make sure your
                vanilla pod is pliable and not dry and hard. If not available sub 1 tsp
                tsp of vanilla paste or extract. 
            </p>
            <p>
                **<em>Do not use</em> spiced rums or cheap swill. Bacardi 8, Don Q Gran Anejo, or
                even better Ron de Barralito 3 star (if you can find it) are all good affordable
                options. This is the single most imporant factor on flavor an quality of coquito.
            </p>
            <p>
                ***Using a blender can cause the drink to become unnecissarily frothy. If you
                have an immersion blender a preferable method would be adding all ingrediants to a 
                pitcher and blending fully with an immersion blender.
