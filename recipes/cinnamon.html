        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This <em>simple</em> recipe adds a huge amount of flavor to any drink. Great
                with rum, tequila, and bourbon, this syrup will build body anywhere it is used, 
                and can accentuate any drink needing a simple syrup. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The secret to a great cinnamon syrup is <strong>not</strong> using plain brown 
                sugar! Go the extra mile and find some demerara sugar, turbinado, or panela if 
                you can find it. These much darker sugars will add complexity and depth to the syrup
                that will translate into any drink it is used with. 
            </p>

        <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p>
                *If you cannot find demerara or panela sugar, check the hispanic section of your
                grocery store. If you still cannot locate these sugars, turbinado is a good substitute.
